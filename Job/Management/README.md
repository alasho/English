### Evaluation
- I've already experienced project management before, 
but team management and evaluation are new to me, so it might be difficult.
- 
#### difficult point in evaluation (quantify and compare, also convince)
A difficult thing in evaluation is to quantify what each member do as a task
and compare it among members to decide who is qualified to be promoted or raised thier salary.
And also, it is hard task to explain them why they were not raised when I choosed raise other member's salary.

#### quantify
For example, we engineers write a programiming code everyday to improve own system, adding new functions, fixing bugs and vulnerabilities.
In order to evaluate each task, which number shoud be used ?
- Time : how long did it take to finish 
- Difficulty : how difficult the task was
- Revenue : how much revenue the task brought to sales-division

Note that some enginner tasks are far from direct revenue.
So, Generally, it's difficult to trace which task brought profit directly

#### compare (trade-off)
Thinking that, there are two members, "Jeff" who fixed many bugs and "Tom" who added new functions,
and which person should be raised ?
In other case, in order to evaluate engineers, we have to think trade-off 
between quority and quantity of outputs or quality and speed.


#### explain to convince
Even if we defined a quantified goal and one of members accomprished his goal,
promotion and raise are not guranteed.
Who to Promote or raise will be decided in human-resource commitee
and all team manager can do is only to leave a comment to a document for the commitee.
I mean promotion and raise is out of controll for any managers.
